Abstract
This paper presents a parallel tabu search algorithm for the container loading problem with
a single container to be loaded. The emphasis is on the case of a weakly heterogeneous load.
The distributed-parallel approach is based on the concept of multi-search threads according to
Toulouse et al. [Issues in designing parallel and distributed search algorithms for discrete optimization
problems, Publication CRT-96-36, Centre de recherche sur les transports, Universitede
Montreal, Canada, 1996] i.e., several search paths are investigated concurrently. The
parallel searches are carried out by differently configured instances of a tabu search algorithm,
which cooperate by the exchange of (best) solutions at the end of defined search phases. The
parallel search processes are executed on a corresponding number of LAN workstations. The
efficiency of the parallel tabu search algorithm is demonstrated by an extensive comparative
test including well-known reference problems and loading procedures from other authors.

In the interest of stability of the load, both horizontal dimensions of each box are
to be supported according to a predefined percentage. In any case the centre of gravity
of each box must be supported in order to avoid boxes tipping over. It is assumed
that the centre of gravity and the geometric centre of each box coincide.
Box types are defined as follows. Two boxes are the same type if they coincide in
all three side dimensions. On the basis of this concept of box types, the following
three categories of box sets can be distinguished. A homogeneous box set is given
if all boxes are of the same type. A box set is called weakly heterogeneous if there
exist a few box types and many items per type. Finally, a strongly heterogeneous
box set is characterized by a greater number of box types and only few items per
type. Here, a weakly heterogeneous set of boxes is assumed.
In the recent years, many (sequential) solution methods for the container loading
problem have been developed. It is well known that the container loading problem is
NP-hard (cf. [18]). Hence, the methods developed are heuristic approaches.

The only block of a 1-arrangement is always placed in the reference corner of the
packing space. From the two blocks of a 2-arrangement, one is arranged in the
reference corner. The second block can alternatively be placed as a neighbour in
x-direction (arrangement type ‘‘in front of’’), as a neighbour in y-direction (arrangement
type ‘‘beside’’) or as a neighbour in z-direction (arrangement type ‘‘above’’). In
the case of a placement according to arrangement type ‘‘in front of’’, the block with
the larger y-dimension is positioned in the reference corner, while for the arrangement
type ‘‘beside’’ the block with the larger x-dimension is positioned in the reference
corner. The arrangement type ‘‘above’’ is only used if both horizontal
dimensions of a block are not smaller than the corresponding dimensions of the
other block. The block with the larger horizontal dimensions is positioned in the reference
corner and the other above. Fig. 2 illustrates a 1-arrangement and two 2-
arrangements of the arrangement types ‘‘in front of’’ and ‘‘beside’’.
